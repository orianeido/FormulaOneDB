# FormulaOneDB

Final project for the courses Database Systems (SQL) and Object Oriented Design (Design Patterns in Java). 
I did the project on one of my loves, Formula 1.  
The software provides information on the Drivers, Constructors and various Grand Prix races that have been held from 1950 to 2020.    

As database I use MySQL on a local server, the design of the ERD and building the table was all done by me as part of the course requirment.  
The sofware was program in Java emphasizing the use of 3 design patterns.
